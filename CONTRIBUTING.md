Contributing guidelines
====
First off, thank you for considering contributing to Pulse. It's people like you that make Pulse such great software.

The importance of reading
----
Following these guidelines helps to communicate with the rest of developers because managing and developing an open source project is time-consuming, with these guidelines we want to reduce these time making easier to address your issue, assess changes, and help you finalize your pull requests.

Where can I contribute?
----
Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, submitting bug reports, writing tutorials, or even writing code which can be incorporated in the project are all examples of helpful contributions. We love to receive contributions from our community and especially from you! If you want to add new features check out our [Projects](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/Pulse/projects) to know the requested functionality.

Expectations for behavior
----
When the users contribute to this project we don't just want you to know how to communicate with others, see our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/sertxudeveloper/Pulse/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), also technical responsibilities.

* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.

* Keep pull requests as small as possible, preferably one pull request per new feature.

How to submit a contribution
----

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
   * Be sure you the changes work properly
   * Send a pull request indicating the modifications you made.

#### If you have a different process for small or "obvious" fixes, let them know

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.

Changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:
* Spelling / grammar fixes
* Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
* Comment clean up
* Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
* Adding logging messages or debugging output
* Changes to 'metadata' files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
* Moving source files from one directory or package to another

How to report a bug
----
#### Security disclosures
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email dev.sertxu@gmail.com instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at dev.sertxu@gmail.com.

#### Bug report
When creating an issue make sure you select the bug report template. Make sure you filled all the requested data, this will help the maintainers and contributors to handle the issue.

Suggest a feature or enhancement
----
Where open to new ideas to add new features to this project. Feel free to propose new features, or even create them yourself.

### Explain your desired process for suggesting a feature.
If there is back-and-forth or signoff required, say so. Ask them to scope the feature, thinking through why itâ€™s needed and how it might work.

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in Pulse, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
